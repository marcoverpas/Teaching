# Teaching

These `R` codes replicate the three basic models in macroeconomics:

1. An early *neoclassical* model
  
1. A *Keynes-like* model
  
1. The model associated with the so-called *Neoclassical-Keynesian Synthesis*

In addition, the codes for a *post-Keynesian* model, a *stock-flow consistent* post-Keynesian model, a *Marxian* model, and a *mainstream* one, are provided.
